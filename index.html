<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    In task 1 we implemented converting coordinates from an images and outputting a ray in the world space. In addition, we also generated pixel samples by generating ns_aa rays and estimating the global illumination associated with that ray. We also implemented ray intersection for triangles and spheres in task 1. In task 2 we implemented Bounding Volume Hierarchy to speed up our ray-intersection tests. We split the nodes for BVHs using the median of the longest axis. To test for intersection in our BVH, we checked whether our ray intersected the bounding box using the slab method discussed in lecture. If there was an intersection and the node was a leaf node, we intersected with every primitive and returned the closest intersection. Otherwise, we intersected the left and right nodes and returned the closest hit among them. In part 3, we implemented f(w_i -> w_o) for ideal diffuse BSDFs. In addition, we also implemetned zero bounce illumination and one bounce illumination. Finally, we implemented importance sampling for one bounce illumination. This allows us to choose between using uniform hemisphere sampling and importance sampling. In part 4 we implemented global illumination with Russian Roulette. We implemented global illumination as discussed in lecture (shown in Task 4). For task 5 we implemented adaptive sampling. Adaptive sampling allows for us to concentrate samples in more difficult parts of the image.
</p>
<p>
    One of the bugs we encountered in Task 2 was that our images were rendering at the same speed as without using the BVH. This occured because we were iterating through all the primitives instead of only the primitves in the bounding box. One issue we encountered for Task 4 was that our spheres weren't rendering correctly. Our spheres had a distinct dividing line indicating the difference between being in the shadows and being in the light. This was fixed by only adding the recursive call if the cosine of w_j was positive.
</p>
<p>
  We collaborated on this project by splitting the work for various parts. We collaborated together on part 1. Derwin worked on Task 1 (constructing the BVH), and Truc worked on intersecting the bounding box and intersecting the BVH for part 2. For part 3, Derwin worked on Task 1 and Task 2 (bsdf, and zero-bounce illumination) and Truc worked on direct lighting with uniform hemisphere sampling and importance sampling. Derwin worked on Part 4 (global illumination), and Truc worked on Part 5 (adaptive sampling).

<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection (20 Points)</h2>


<h3>
  Walk through the ray generation and primitive intersection parts of the rendering pipeline.
</h3>
<p>
  Ray generation generates the normalized image coordinates(x, y) to a ray in the world space. The image coordinate (0, 0) maps to the bottom left corner in camera space. The image coordinate (1, 1) maps to the top right corner in the camera space. We can find the bottom left and top right coordinates of the sensor by using equations (-tan(hFov/2 2), -tan(vFov / 2), -1) and (tan(hFov/2 2), tan(vFov / 2), -1) respectively. hFov and vFov are field of view angles along X and Y axis. Since x and y are in the range [0, 1], we can convert x, y to the offset within virtual camera sensor. Now, x_offset = (top_right.x - bottom_left.x) * y, and y_offset = (top_right.y - bottom_left.y) * y. The position of x in the camera space is (bottom_left.x + x_offset). The position of y in the camera space is (bottom_left.y + y_offset)
</p>

<p>We convert camera space's coordinate (x, y) to world space by multiplying it with c2w. After that, we initialize a ray with normalized vector (x, y) and with an origin as pos. Ray intersection helps us stimulate the lighting of the scence by rendering reflections, refractions, and shadows. We have implementations that check for triangle intersection and sphere intersection.</p>
<br>
  
 <p>Ray-Triangle Intersection: We used Moller Trumbore algorithm to check if the ray intersects with the triangle. If the ray intersects with the triangle, we update ray.max_t as t. </p>
 <p>Ray-Sphere Intersection: We check if the ray intersection by solving the quadratic equation below: </p>

  <p>After solving for t, we need to check if t is in the range from ray.min_t to ray.max_t and update ray.max_t as t so that the intersections are farther away can be ignored.</p>

<h3>
  Explain the triangle intersection algorithm you implemented in your own words.

<p>
  We used Moller Trumbore algorithm to test if the ray intersects with a triangle or not. A point inside a triangle is given by
</p>

<p>P = O + tD = (1 - b1 - b2)P_0 + b1 * P1 + b2 * P2</p>

<p>b1, and b2 are the barycentric coordinates of the triangle. b1, b2, and t can be found by solving the linear system of equations below</p>

<p>The ray only intersects with a triangle if t >= 0 and ray.min_t <= t <= ray.max_t. After that, we update ray.max_t as t so that the intersections are farther away can be ignored.</p>

<h3>
  Walk through your BVH construction algorithm. Explain the heuristic you chose for picking the splitting point.
</h3>
<p>
    We constructed our BVH in the following way. The construct_bvh(start, end, max_leaf_size) takes in two iterators of primitives start and end, and max_leaf_size which is the largest possible size of our leaf nodes. We create a bounding box for every primitive between start and end. If the number of primitives stored is at most max_leaf_size, we return the node. Otherwise, we split our node into two: left_node, and right_node. The heuristic we used for splitting is the median along the longest axis. The long_axis(start, end) function calculates the longest axis by iterating through the primitives between start and end and taking the maximum difference along the x, y, and z axis. The centroid of the bounding boxes are used as the x, y, and z coordinates for comparison. Inside the left_node, we store the bounding box for all primitives whose bounding box's centroid lie to the left of the axis. Conversely, we store the bounding box for all primitives whose bounding box's centroid lies to the right of the axis. If either left_node or right_node is empty, we split the other node so that both nodes contain an equal number of primitives. After that, we set our node's left and right child appropriately and return the node. The image below shows using the median of the longest axis.

  We tested for whether a ray intersected our BVH in the following way. The intersect(ray r, intersection i, node n) returns true if our ray intersected the bounding box of our node, and updates the intersection field appropriately. If the node is a leaf node, we check whether the ray intersects the bounding box of our node (method shown below). If yes, we go through every primitve in this node, and check whether the ray intersects the primitve. For every primitive intersected, we keep track of the closest intersection and update intersection data if we find a closer intersection. If our node is not a leaf-node, we run intersect(ray r, intersection i, left_child) and intersect(ray r, intersection i, right_child) respectively. The second image below outlines the psuedocode for our intersection algorithm.

  The following six images below show the differences between rendering times for the images cow.dae, CBCoil.dae, and Beetle.dae. The left column shows the rendering with no BVH acceleration, and the right column shows rendering with BVH acceleration. Without BVH acceleration, the cow.dae, CBCoil.dae, and Beetle.dae files take 35.7531 seconds, 50.467 seconds, and 50.6151 seconds respectively. With BVH acceleration, the cow.dae, CBCoil.dae, and Beetle.dae files takes 0.1835 seconds, 0.1246 seconds, and 0.1173 seconds respectively. With BVH acceleration, the files render 400-500 times faster. This makes sense since a BVH ideally reduces ray intersection complexity from O(n) to O(log(n))

<h3>
  Walk through both implementations of the direct lighting function.
</h3>
<p>
  Since BRDF represents the ratio of incoming light scattered from incident direction to outgoing direction, and Lambertian BSDF reflects the incomming radiance uniform across the hemisphere, then the diffuse BSDF is given by this->reflectance/pi.
</p>

<p>Zero-bounce illumination refers to a light that comes from a light source. When the light intersects with the object, we only need to compute the light that results from no bounce of light, which is the emission of the object that was intersected.</p>

<p>There are 2 methods for direct lighting. The first one is estimate_direct_lighting_hemisphere, the second one is estimate_direct_lighting_importance.</p>

<p>estimate_direct_lighting_hemisphere estimates the direct lightning on a point by sampling all the light source uniformly in the hemisphere. We compute this by using a Monte Carlo estimator. For importance sampling, we iterate through all the lights in the scene. If the light is a point light, we calculate using the Monte Carlo Estimator described above. In the other case, we take ns_area_light samples to get an average of the light that hits the pixel.</p>

<h3>

<p>
  We implemented global illumination in the function at_least_one_bounce_radiance(ray r, intersection i). The function at_least_one_bounce_radiance(ray r, intersection i) takes in a ray and an intersection, and returns indirect illumination (illumination other than one_bounce_radiance and zero_bounce_radiance). First, we sample an incoming ray direction with the function sample_f(ray out, ray* in, double* pdf) and store the associated radiance in emitted_light (L(p, w_j)). The in pointer stores the incoming ray direction in object-space coordinates and the pdf pointer stores the probability density function evaluated at in (p(w_j)). We convert w_i to world space coordinates and generate a new ray with its origin at the intersection point and its direction in w_i. If the new ray intersects the BVH, we recursively calculate as shown in the second image below.

<p> The above images show CBbunny rendered with direct illumination and indirect illumination. The images were rendered with 1024 samples per pixel, a maximum ray depth of 5, and 16 pixels per light ray. One notable difference is that the ceiling of the Cornell Box is black in indirect illumination. This makes sense because zero-bounce illumination is responsible for the ceiling of the Cornell box being bright. In addition, the top of the bunny in indirect illumination is much darker. This makes sense because one-bounce illumination is responsible for casting rays which hit the camera after one bounce.

    The above images show CBbunny.dae rendered with max_ray_depths set to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 100. The images were rendered with 1024 samples per pixel and 16 pixels per light ray. If max-ray depth is set to 0, only zero-bounce illumination occurs, so the Cornell box is black except at the ceiling. If max-ray depth is set to 1, the bunny has darker shadows, and the lower portion of its body is darker. As we transition from a max_ray_depth of 2 to 3, the room gets lighter overall. There is not a significant difference between setting max_ray_depth to 100 and max_ray_depth to 3. This occurs because Russian Roulette will terminate early, so most rays will have a depth of 4-7.

    The above images show lambertian spheres with pixel sampling rates of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 64, and 1024. The images were rendered with a max ray depth of 5, and 4 samples per light ray. With 1, 2, and 4 samples per pixel, there is a lot of noise. This makes sense because it is unlikely for the pixels to converge with a small sample size. With 8 and 16 samples per pixel, there is less noise per pixel. With 64 and 1024 samples per pixel, most of the noise is eliminated. This demonstrates that most pixels converge around 64 samples per pixel.

<h3>
  Explain adaptive sampling. Walk through your implementation of the adaptive sampling.

<p>
    When sampling, some pixels can converge faster than the other with less sampling rates. With adaptive sampling, we can stop sampling the pixel when the pixel is already 
    converged.
</p> 

<p>We use a simple algorithm to indicate if a pixel has converged. Given </p>

      </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>If I <= maxTolerance * μ, where maxTolerance=0.05 by default, we can say that the pixel has converged. </p>

<p>Inside the for loop of function raytrace_pixel, we need to keep track 2 variables: </p>

</p>

<p>After that, we can compute the mean and variance of n variables so far</p>

<div align="center">
  <table style="width=100%">

      </tr>

</div>
<br>
<p>Now that we know the mean and variance, we can compute <bold>I</bold> and check if <bold>I</bold> less than or equal to maxTolerance * μ. If
   I has converged, we can terminate the for loop and stop sampling the pixel. After that, we store the number of samples in sampleCountBuffer 
   and divide the result by that number of samples.
